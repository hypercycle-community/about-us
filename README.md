##What is HyperCycle?
HyperCycle is building a tiny but essential component that enables AI Machines to transact with other AI machines in a sub-second finality which results in an unprecedented emergence

##How does the node work?
Metaphorically speaking: The node does to AI what the web browser did to humans. Or what the Synapses do for the neurons to communicate inside the brain. That enablement, although on its own not sufficient, is necessary for the future of a cooperative AI at a modular level.

##Monetize any machine with HyperCycle!
Your machine can be remote or local. Your participation in AI computation can enhance the intelligence of the global brain. 
Consumers don't interact nor call Cisco, Oracle or IBM to operate their electricity bill or online medical record.
HyperCycle is a B2B play. However, providing our customers with tools to enable B2C and ensuring the success of our customers is our number 1 priority.
